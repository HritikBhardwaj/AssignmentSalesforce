I have created a lwc component which is added to community page in saesforce. 
I have designed it as sales-representative will take customer details which after saving the record will send 
a mail to customer where customer can add more details around the info asked
After filling in details by customer, I am updating the same customer record in salesforce org.
After saving the record I am calling out POST api.
